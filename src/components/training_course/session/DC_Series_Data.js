  ],
  overview: [
    "Waterlines cooling & die spray are two important thermal management activities used to remove heat from the die and maintain the earlier pre-set die temperature for achieving consistent casting quality & ensuring a reasonable die life performance. A too low die temperature cools the metal flow and increases the percent of solidified metal in the melt stream which can easily cause surface defect problems while too hot a die will subject the expensive tooling to thermal damages such as heat checking, soldering & erosion or hot wear attack. The training will highlight the importance of doing thermal analysis in the thermal design phase, and engineer the cooling so as to obtain consistent die operating temperatures. The major die temperature controlling factors such as melt temperature, die preheating, water cooling, die spray & cycle time will be reviewed in this 2-day technical program. Course participants will learn & appreciate this up-front engineering effort which will put die thermal conditions in a more robust operating window for a profitable die casting operation.",

  overview: [
    "Control of the metal flow in the die cavity is a key factor in producing sound die castings. A proper feed system design must allow metal flow rapidly and uniformly into the die with minimum heat & pressure loss and at the same time avoiding sharp direction changes, turbulence, and entrapped air. Die casters, buyers and die makers must pay adequate attention during the initial phase of die design or and must provide a check on the feed system design to ensure consistency in the casting quality. This 2-day intensive technical learning course is designed to be interactive and emphasizes a systematic, practical & hands on approach to die casting feed system design. Participants will learn how to develop & specify all the critical dimensions of the metal feed system to enable casting to be made with the desired characteristics.",

  overview: [
    "Pressure die casting involves filling molten metal into a steel die having a cavity with the negative shape of the casting. Besides determining the shape of the casting product, the die acts as a heat sink to cool the casting, provide a vent for trapped air & gases, and contain the mechanism to eject the finished part. Die steel quality & properties are critical factor to ensure the reliable performance of the die for a successful die casting process. The price for premature failure of die is heavy as it involves excessive overhead cost in the die running such as frequent die maintenance (replacing of worn or broken parts, regrind, cleaning, weld repair and re-plating). Worst still, die failure may also cause rejects in casting parts, overtime payments, penalties in late-delivery and loss of company privileges. This course will detail how common die failures can affect casting defects and ways to maximize the life and performance of the production tool. Participants should learn influencing factors for tooling economy on die casting productivity improvement.",
