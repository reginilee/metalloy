  overview: [
    "Hot forging parts are typically used for critical or severe service applications such as automotive components, high pressure fittings, drive train parts, gears, bearings, aircraft landing gear and turbine disks. Quality of hot forged parts involved strength, toughness and geometry. These are established based on materials, processing and tooling specifications. Additionally, requirements for grain flow and defects-free are common. Today, precision forging processes are being performed in controlled presses, forging stock, tooling and process condition. Among others, die failure can be a significant portion of the overall production cost. Hot forging process subject the dies to severe thermal & mechanical fatigue subsequently resulting in die failure primarily through wear, plastic deformation and fatigue fracture. This first series of Hot Forging training program developed by Mr William Lee is specially designed to build up technical competency of engineering and technical staff from hot forging industry. Course participants will learn the nitty-gritty of various forging processes and vital variables to control the processing of their engineering forged parts & die performance through this systematic and information pack 2 days technical training program.",

  overview: [
    "A wide variety of materials can be used for forging, but by far the largest proportion of parts produced is from carbon and alloy steels, with a significant number also made from light alloys suchas Aluminium. Quality of hot forged parts involved strength, toughness and geometry. The materialselected for a forging application must be able to achieve the required physical and mechanicalproperties. Forging difficulty vary according to type of selected forging material.  For example, manyhigh‐strength aluminium alloys are more difficult to process than steels. Increase in forging difficultyis represented by increased forging load requirements and usually reduced die life. In addition, forthe more difficult to deform materials it may be impossible to obtain very thin sections (ribs andwebs), and consequently the end product must be less close to net shape than for the easier to forgematerials.This second series of Hot Forging training program developed by Mr William Lee is specially designedto build up technical competency of engineering and technical staff from hot forging industry onunderstanding of forging materials.",

  overview: [
    "Hot forging dies are subjected to both high thermal and mechanical stresses. This complex stress situation can affect forging die performance and limit their service life. The die material used must have a sufficient resistance against dynamic bending, cracking with varying temperatures, wear and plastic deformation. For these reasons proper tool material combined with engineering tool design, fabrication and heat treatment must be closely controlled in order to produce a reliable hot forging tool with good temper resistance, good wear resistance, high hot yield strength, good thermal conductivity and good thermal fatigue resistance. The 3rd series of Hot Forging training program developed by Mr William Lee is specially designed to build up technical competency of engineering and technical staff from hot forging industry on howto attain minimum hot forging die quality for performance and durability. Course participants will learn the insights of hot forging die materials, their properties for hot forging application andpotential risk factors during tool material selection, tool making & hardening process which canaffect the die life and performance.",
