  overview: [
    "The production cost for cold forging depends significantly on the tool life. Owing to high forging loads & tool stresses, cold forging is one of the most demanding metal forming applications. Therefore, selection of proper tool materials & tool making control are vital for the success of cold forging process. This 2-day technical program is specially designed for forging industry to emphasize on finding tool materials with a combination of high strength and toughness to withstand the typically high forming stress from the cold forging process as well as adopting proper tool making procedures to perfect tooling condition prior tool running. The training is intended to improve understanding of tooling material & tool making practices of both cemented carbides & tool steel materials including high performance powder metallurgy & high speed tool steel grades. The trainer will explain the WHAT and HOW variables & limitations that could affect the performance of cold forging tools and providing material solutions to counter wear, chipping & cracking problems.",

  overview: [
    "The second cold forging training series specially designed for cold forging industry will discuss the die failures modes, troubleshooting & prevention to ensure reliable tooling performance for a profitable cold forming process. Owing to high forging loads & tool stresses, the service life of cold forging tools & performance are usually limited by fatigue failure, which causes fracture during repetition of forming blows, and by wear, which affects the dimensional tolerance of formed products. Replacement of broken or worn dies is clearly expensive. Lean manufacturing is harder to implement with inconsistent tool life. In addition, the unpredictability of tool life results in higher inventory levels as manufacturers try to keep the production running. It is thus imperative to understand the failures mechanism of cold forging tools to prevent future premature tool failures. The trainer will explain steps in troubleshooting tools failures, common cold forging tool failure modes including fatigue, wear and fracture, recommendations to extend tools life.",

  overview: [
    "In considering ways of improving forging tools performance, quality hardening plays an important role in attaining desirable characteristics & properties, primarily increased toughness, strength & greater wear resistance. Tooling is a skillful & capital investment effort. Tool makers and tool users depend on the heat treaters to make their investment paid-off. Professional heat treater gives the fabricated products the final touch of quality that makes them usable & reliable to do the job they are intended to do. This course is designed to provide a practical approach on how to evaluate and attain quality hardening result for forging tools (high alloyed tool steel grades). The program will give detailed coverage on potential hardening problems associated with poor heat-treating practices. It is design to make participants familiar with the heat treating principles, proper steps in heating, quenching & tempering, common hardening failures, solutions to overcome it and terminology of hardening process. Participants will learn many of the basic fundamental metallurgical aspect of hardening and the various effects brought about by heat treating on the properties of tool steels including the benefits and limitations for tooling performance.",
