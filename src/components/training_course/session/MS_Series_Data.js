    "Sheet metal forming is a technological important process in manufacturing industries that allows economical production of parts with complex shapes from flat sheet stock. Sheet metal forming involves bending, drawing processes & their many variations. Metal forming relies on metal's ability to flow plastically in the solid state without significant change in its properties. This course provides an in-depth study of materials characteristics during forming process include the impact of materials properties & quality on formability, changes of materials properties after forming, measuring materials formability, analyzing forming modes, troubleshooting forming defects (springback, wrinkles, fracture, thinning, work hardening, residual stress) etc. Course participants will gain a lot from this 2-day technical short course and learn how to fine tune their existing practices with a more scientific and systematic approach for further development in forming process and improve parts quality & production economy.",

  overview: [
    "Sheet metal forming involves the transformation of a flat sheet of metal into a useful shape. Bending is the most common of all sheet metal forming processes in which a Box-shape, V-shape, U-shape, or channel shape is produced along a straight axis in ductile materials such as steel & aluminium metals. Typical products that are made using bending process are electronic & computer enclosures, card cages, rectangular ductwork, piping tubes and instrument chassis.This course provides an in-depth study of bending process, bending analysis, study of sheet metal characteristics & properties for bendability, troubleshooting bending defects (springback, wrinkles, fracture, thinning, distortion and residual stress) and design guidelines to achieve quality bending results. Practical staff will gain valuable technical knowledge & experience from this 2-day informative technical short course and get to learn the logical reasoning for their daily doings while the advanced employees will study the practical engineering theory to assist their R&D for a scientific and systematic approach to improve products quality & production economy.",

  overview: [
    "Formability problems such as cracks, necking, wrinkles, loose metal, and surface defects may be caused by product design. Other causes can be the result of poor processing methods, poor die design and maintenance procedures, improper lubrication, nonconforming sheet material, and other typical underlying factors. In order to solve some of these problems in a more effective manner, we need to take corrective action based on part data rather than just guessing. Surface strain using circle grid analysis and thickness strain analysis are practical methods of measuring the forming severity of a formed part in a scientific way. It not only can help solve issues such as splitting, but it also can serve as a tool to let you know how far the part is from failing. This 2-day informative technical training will teach the use of advanced formability assessment techniques (CGA & TSA) in order to solve the root cause of a stamping problem, how to procure basic visual data, and then proceed to derive more finite data and comparing the metal’s forming limit by using forming limit diagram for building a robust working window for profitable sheet metal forming.",
