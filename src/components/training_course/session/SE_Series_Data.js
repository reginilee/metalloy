    "Despite the controlled environment, process and use of precision tools, a high number of semiconductor packages are rejected. A considerable amount of rejects are due to premature semiconductor tooling failures such as wear, dimensional changes, deformation, chipping & fracture. Analyzing tool failures and their causes require an understanding of all the variables in the tool making & maintenance process. Correcting for defects requires some processing control on these highly precision parts. This program provides understanding of how top-quality precision tools and long tool life can improve the package assembly quality & productivity. Participants will gain extensive understanding of various tool processing & their effects to the tooling materials properties and behavior so that proper pre-treatment, during treatment and post-treatment measures can be controlled correctly. This lead to reduce risk of premature tool failure during tool usage time and improve package productivity & yield.",

    "Today's semiconductor industry requires manufacturing at low costs and high quality. Rejects and tooling downtime are killing. Therefore, continuous productivity improvement throughout the microelectronic packaging assembly process is essential to achieve production economy. Molding and trim & form process are critical manufacturing activities in plastic packaging than any other piece of equipment. This end of line process involves considerable amounts of investment in presses, tooling, floor space & labor. It has a major impact on packaging productivity & yield. The evolution of the technology to higher lead counts, thinner leadframes, and closer lead spacing places greater emphasis on the engineering time devoted to mold, trim & form design, implementation, and problem solving. This comprehensive technical training for semiconductor industry will explain how the leadframe material, tooling, processing methods, preceding & existing operations control can impact the defects & problems in trim & form operations.

  overview: [
    "Transfer moulding with epoxy moulding compound (EMC) is a standard semiconductor assembly process for reliable chip encapsulation since decades. The process is often the culprit in assembly problems that occur downstream of moulding. Examples of this coupling is in the trim and form operation, code marking and testing, as well as overall perception of quality, depend on precisely moulded packages. The two critical steps in producing high quality plastic packaging devices are (1) selection of the moulding material and (2) control of the moulding process itself. Epoxy moulding compound is by far the most commercially important material used for microelectronic packaging. The formulation of most EMCs consists of a complicated and often proprietary mixture of ingredients which can affect the filling characteristics during encapsulation moulding as well as the integrity of moulded body. In addition, controlling time, temperature, pressure, velocity and flow rate are critical issues in the moulding process. Improper moulding parameters can cause severe device failures such as wire sweeping, paddle shift, delamination, incomplete filling, cracking, mould voiding, blistering, and flashing. This course is designed to provide the insights of moulding compound for the improved understanding of encapsulant materials and the process characteristics of transfer moulding for plastic packaging of microelectronic devices. Both practical and fundamental concepts are explained to improve plastic package moulding productivity, yield and ultimate product reliability.",

  overview: [
    "In considering ways of improving semiconductor precision tooling performance or at least to fabricate a reliable tooling, proper hardening & surface coating play an important role to lay down a good foundation and to bring out the desirable characteristics & properties of tooling material. The economic risk factor from this heat treatment process is high as poor quality hardening is a main source of tool failures during tool making and subsequent production running (including future coating plan). While machining may produce the shape or external finishes to tools, dies & moulds, heat-treating gives the fabricated products the final touch of quality that makes them usable & reliable to do the job they are intended to do. In addition, the applications & characteristics of various thin-film coatings such as TiN, TiCN, TiAlN, CrN and DLC layers to improve tooling performance are not fully understood. This program will teach course participants one of the very important industry missing-link study on how to achieve and ensure good quality hardening and to make full use of thin film coating. It is design to make participants familiar with the process principles, control of variables, common failures and solutions to overcome it as well as various testing and inspection techniques to examine the results.",

Defects can be eliminated or minimized through careful control of processing parameters, optimal package design, environmental conditions, and material selection. Identification of the contributing factors is an important step in the process of elimination and prevention of package defects and failures.This specially design information packed technical training provides an overview of potential defects and failures in a plastic-encapsulated package and discusses defects and types of failures associated with the electronic plastic packages, failure mechanisms, the contributing factors, and precaution.",
