  overview: [
    "Poor quality hardening is the single largest source of tool failures during tool making or in subsequent service. By the time when the tools are ready for hardening, they are already worth a lot of money as investment already paid to design fees, tooling materials & machining costs. Improper hardened tools or dies will incur higher overhead costs during tool running as frequent tooling maintenance and repair are required. In addition, poorly hardenedtools & dies will affect the tooling performance and produce scrap during production. Thus, the economical risk factor from hardening is high. This program will teach course participants one of the very important industry skills on how to achieve and ensure good quality heat treating job. It is design to make participants familiar with the heat treatment principles, processes, common heat treatment failures, solutions to overcome it and terminology of hardening process. The program will also present practical data for use in hardening shop. Participants will learn many of the basic fundamental metallurgical aspect of hardening and the various effects brought about by heat treating on the properties of tool steels including the benefits and limitations for tool life performance.",

  overview: [
    "One of the first steps towards a longer tool life is the selection of proper tool steel with the right properties and good quality as tooling material. The drive for improved tooling economy has resulted in the development of many tool steel grades. Many times, a tooling problem is a result of lack of knowledge of the tooling material from the many hundreds that are available. There are several criteria on which the wise decision is normally based. Selection of optimum grade for a given tooling application required understanding of the various characteristics and structure-property relationships, as well as the making techniques of refining the steel. The more familiar a technical person with the material knowledge, the more proficient and confident he or she will be to make judicious materials choices based on these criteria. This course is designed to provide an in-depth study of tool steels, including their standards, classifications, properties, limitations, applications and selection guides. Participants will learn material factors that help to determine tool performance and how to select proper tool steel that is compatible with the design & planned processing procedure.",

    "Carbide tool materials have gained most acceptance in metal cutting sector, however, the applications of these group of hard metal as press working tools are steadily growing as a result of advancement in today's production technology emphasizing high speed, high accuracy, high productivity as well as longer tool life duration. As for machining applications, nearly 50% of errors made in metal cutting processes are the wrong choice of carbide grades. The potentials of applying carbide materials in certain manufacturing operations which may yield higher production economy are not fully exploited. Also, the applications & characteristics of various thin-film coatings such as TiN, TiCN, TiAlN, CrN and DLC layers to improve tooling performance are not fully understood. This course reveals the secret of cemented carbides and will present the classification, manufacture and composition of cemented carbides, physical and mechanical properties, carbide cutting tools & press tools failures & prevention, various hard surface coatings employed to condition working surface, machining & non-machining applications of carbides tool materials.",

    "Tooling performance is influenced by the materials properties. The study of tooling properties, testing methods & its control has become in recent years an integral part of tooling design, manufacturing quality and productivity improvement program. Proper tooling material selection based on their nature and properties that anticipate material weaknesses - proper materials engineering, can prevent most tool failures. Hundreds of properties are tested & measured in workshop & laboratories for the purpose of comparing materials. The buyer must decide the properties required of a tooling material. It is the purpose of this course to define the tooling properties, what are the contributing factors to enhance its achievability, how to test, measure, control & how they apply to the application; and what properties are desirable to combat various failures such as dimensional & shape changes, cracking, corrosion and wear problems. Participants will learn how to specify 'required properties' and how to control actual properties from the 2 most common tooling materials (tool steels & cemented carbide) and to present guidelines to assist the engineering practitioners in selecting the right property for a given job.",
