Some components suffer two or all of these modes of deterioration. Equipment, tooling and product failures represent one of the most persistent and expensive problems in the operation of many companies and industries. Chronic problems cause significant losses of availability of plant while catastrophic failures can cause injuries and major disruption to industries. This course present a systematic approach to failure understanding for the non-metallurgist as well as those who are new to the field or those who want to acquire knowledge of the principles of various mechanical and metallurgical failures.",
