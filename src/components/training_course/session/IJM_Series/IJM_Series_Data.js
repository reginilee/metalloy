One way to get a control on them is to organize a sequential moulding process in order to isolate non related parameters and define the root cause of problem.This 3-day hands-on workshop training is designed to train moulding practitioners on how to establish a robust injection moulding process, using the scientific moulding technique. A scientific moulding technique is an efficient & repeatable moulding process with a large processing window. Using this technique to develop a stable & reliable moulding process is also an important prerequisite prior running DOE for injection moulding. The training will conduct a series of practical experiments to determine shot size, transfer position, cushion size, plastic temperature, fill time, part weight, gate seal time, holding pressure etc. In addition, it will review important aspect of factors in injection moulding, proper process documentation and how to use the achieved data to develop original process or for process revalidation purpose.",
